# About this repo

This repop contains the last solo project from Scrimba frontend career path module 11 (basic react). It is a quiz-app built with react and according to given figma design patterns.
The quizz-app uses the open trivia database (https://opentdb.com/). Every round contains five questions of random topics. After checking you see total score and correct answers.

Live demo available via: https://glittering-cassata-ee02c4.netlify.app

I used vite.js for creating the react boilerplate.
